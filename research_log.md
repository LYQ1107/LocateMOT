## 2026-08-19 Stage L11 — OVMOT temporal pseudo-track + KITTI front-end

- Hypothesis: unmatched DLA detections on expanded TAO-train OVMOT
  stream must receive high-precision temporal pseudo-track supervision
  instead of "every detection is NEW"; KITTI RMOT DetPr ~1% is a
  candidate front-end problem, fixable with category whitelist + NMS +
  query-conditioned CLIP top-k.
- Implementation:
  - Pseudo-track generator (forward + backward cycle consistency,
    appearance/motion/category filters, confidence gating) for all 500
    TAO train videos; sidecars in `outputs/l11/data/pseudo_tracks`.
  - Class-A GT upgraded from C-TAO base @0.5 IoU to base_and_novel
    @0.3 IoU (~10% -> ~28% coverage).
  - Trainer: no_unmatched_new, confidence-weighted identity/relevance
    losses, pseudo ids in the same slot/lifecycle machinery.
  - KITTI: whitelist + cross-NMS + top-30 -> ~15.3 cands/frame (was 50);
    CLIP top-12 calibration: query precision 10.2%, target recall 65%.
- Quality: pseudo same-ID precision 99.26% (8-video audit, target 90%);
  cycle pass 0.997; NEW rate 0.110 vs L10 collapse ~1.0.
- Running: 4-GPU repair training (from L9-ovmot, ~6-8 s/step),
  repaired-KITTI eval (L9-ovmot ckpt), 10-video OVMOT over-birth
  baseline: unique/rows 0.211 (L9), reused IDs 467.
- Pending: step-7000 OVMOT quick eval, full TAO TETA, KITTI TrackEval,
  L12 prompt seeding.
