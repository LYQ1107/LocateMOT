## 2026-08-19 Stage L11 — OVMOT temporal pseudo-track + KITTI front-end

- Hypothesis: unmatched DLA detections on expanded TAO-train OVMOT
  stream must receive high-precision temporal pseudo-track supervision
  instead of "every detection is NEW"; KITTI RMOT DetPr ~1% is a
  candidate front-end problem, fixable with category whitelist + NMS +
  query-conditioned CLIP top-k.
- Implementation:
  - Pseudo-track generator (forward + backward cycle consistency,
    appearance/motion/category filters, confidence gating) for all 500
    TAO train videos; sidecars in `outputs/l11/data/pseudo_tracks`.
  - Class-A GT upgraded from C-TAO base @0.5 IoU to base_and_novel
    @0.3 IoU (~10% -> ~28% coverage).
  - Trainer: no_unmatched_new, confidence-weighted identity/relevance
    losses, pseudo ids in the same slot/lifecycle machinery.
  - KITTI: whitelist + cross-NMS + top-30 -> ~15.3 cands/frame (was 50);
    CLIP top-12 calibration: query precision 10.2%, target recall 65%.
- Quality: pseudo same-ID precision 99.26% (8-video audit, target 90%);
  cycle pass 0.997; NEW rate 0.110 vs L10 collapse ~1.0.
- Running: 4-GPU repair training (from L9-ovmot, ~6-8 s/step),
  repaired-KITTI eval (L9-ovmot ckpt), 10-video OVMOT over-birth
  baseline: unique/rows 0.211 (L9), reused IDs 467.
- Pending: step-7000 OVMOT quick eval, full TAO TETA, KITTI TrackEval,
  L12 prompt seeding.

## 2026-08-20 continued

- Low-LR continuation (10000->11000, LR~6e-6): RMOT-Dance 32.49 ->
  34.05 HOTA; ordinary Macro 0.4855 -> 0.4924.  OVMOT full TETA on
  s11k running.
- Fresh-optimizer balance run (p_rmot 0.45/p_ovmot 0.20) REJECTED at
  step 1000 (RMOT 32.06 / ordinary 0.4663).
- L12 frozen prompt-seeded (DAVIS 2017, 10 multi-object videos):
  mask/point > box for identity robustness; joint fine-tune not
  launched (mixed signal).  Infrastructure complete.

## 2026-09-04 Stage L88 — RMOT-aware GroundingDINO LoRA adaptation

- Hypothesis: a zero-initialized rank-16/alpha-32 LoRA on the final two
  GroundingDINO fusion layers and decoder layer 0, with the frozen L86/L87
  sidecar and causal history, would improve held-out target-bag and
  expression-to-candidate correspondence without changing the L69 bank.
- Contract: label-free, distributed, and temporal regressions passed; full
  V1/V2 fit used seed `20260829`, 40 epochs, 2,640 optimizer steps, world 4,
  effective group batch 8, and 20 even checkpoints. Local MMCV required FP32
  rather than the registered BF16 autocast. Candidate deletion/truncation was
  false and all frozen-base/LoRA gradient and reload checks passed.
- Dev: all 20 checkpoints were scored on 138 video-disjoint groups; the fixed
  selection chose epoch20/Rule B before fixed validation. Checkpoint SHA is
  `7012706140cfa94278ce15bb8da3e2318eb3efcfb8d26d3b1dbc5206f1145538`.
- Fixed semantic validation: immutable L29 was
  `recall=.7333333, precision=.0830189, FP/frame=10.125,
  pred/positive=8.8333, hard=.9166667, multi=.8194444`. L88 candidate-only
  was `recall=.4193548, precision=.1830986, FP/frame=2.4167,
  pred/positive=2.2903, hard=.8461538, multi=.3333333`; final Rule B was
  `recall=.1935484, precision=.1363636, FP/frame=1.5833,
  pred/positive=1.4194, hard=.8461538, multi=.1666667`, with empty rate
  `.5416667` and inactive false acceptance `.5`. The semantic gate failed on
  recall and multi-positive preservation; the lower volume is not a fix.
- Internal TrackEval: selected Rule B produced HOTA `26.0914` (V1) and
  `20.2386` (V2), below L86 `29.1663/21.6467` and L87-A
  `28.5752/22.1300`. No screening or official-test labels were read.
- Preserved failures/fixes: first formal causal-key drift, sparse seqinfo,
  merge, device, and score-shape retries remain in new directories with their
  provenance; no old bank/checkpoint/production entrypoint was overwritten.
- Status: `STOPPED_PENDING_SUPERVISOR_REVIEW`; no L88 long continuation,
  screening, official test, TrackEval beyond internal validation, or
  ordinary MOT/OVMOT change is authorized. Unique next action is supervisor
  review of one new RMOT correspondence/proposal design.

## 2026-09-05 Stage L88C — corrected candidate-vs-NULL replay

- Hypothesis: the prior L88 semantic failure may include an implementation
  error in the candidate-vs-NULL gate. Corrected emission is
  `candidate_energy >= candidate_threshold` AND
  `candidate_energy-null_logit >= null_margin` AND
  `presence_logit >= presence_threshold`; candidate-only uses only the first
  condition. No training, backward, optimizer, checkpoint update, bank
  change, top-k/NMS or NULL suppression was performed.
- Implementation: refit all 20 even checkpoints on the registered B/R/P
  grids, replayed the corrected shortlist (epochs 8/20/40/30/4) over complete
  V1/V2 dev video, ran the corrected internal TrackEval matrix, froze epoch
  30 Rule B before fixed validation, and ran the fixed 16-calibration/
  24-validation replay. A first TrackEval provenance alias failure was
  preserved; the minimal `scope_key/full_video` alias fix was pushed in
  `c5a6685` and the corrected matrix is attempt2.
- Result: L88C corrected final on validation was
  `recall=.354839, precision=.207547, FP/frame=1.75,
  pred/positive=1.7097, hard=.846154, multi=.305556,
  empty=.375, inactive-FA=.666667`. Immutable L29 remains
  `.733333/.083019/10.125/8.8333/.916667/.819444` for
  recall/precision/FP/pred-positive/hard/multi. Candidate-only recall was
  `.419355`; the corrected NULL comparison removed additional positives.
- Internal dev TrackEval for the frozen epoch30/Rule B was V1
  HOTA/DetA/AssA `.296615/.216472/.408302` and V2
  `.265682/.156622/.451938`; these are dev-only, not screening or official
  results. The semantic gate failed on recall and multi-positive recall.
- Root cause: existing candidate scores have useful average pairwise ranking,
  but the lowest-scoring positives in multi-target bags do not survive the
  fixed emission boundary; V2 is worse. This is a correspondence and
  multi-positive recall failure, not a universal NULL-acceptance,
  coverage, finite/reload, or implementation-smoke failure.
- Preserved outputs: corrected replay, two TrackEval attempts, frozen
  selection, fixed semantic JSON/gate, and offline A–I diagnosis under
  `outputs/l88c/`. Code was pushed to branch
  `codex/l88c-candidate-null-corrected-replay-20260905` at `e8f5f62`.
- Status: `STOPPED_PENDING_SUPERVISOR_REVIEW`. No screening/official-test
  labels, HOTA claim beyond internal dev TrackEval, ordinary MOT/OVMOT/TAO
  change, or new L88C training was run. The only next action is the single
  supervisor approval request in `reports/l88c/NEXT_TEST_APPROVAL_REQUEST.md`.

## 2026-09-06 — L88C recoverable storage cleanup

- While the authorized zero-training L88C final-internal replay was running,
  its open paths were checked. Three superseded L1 intermediate LoRA
  checkpoint directories (`outputs/l1_c/checkpoints/lora/checkpoint-100/200/300`,
  about 8.0G each) were not open by any process and were moved, not deleted,
  to `/data2/usr_for_deadline/locatemot_cleanup_20260906/`.
- Frozen banks, formal reports, current L88 epoch30 checkpoint/cache, and all
  ordinary MOT/OVMOT assets were left in place. `/data1` free space increased
  from about 76G to 114G. The recoverable inventory is documented in
  `reports/l88c/L88C_RESOURCE_CLEANUP_20260906.md`.

## 2026-09-07 Stage L89 — query-conditioned set correspondence decoder

- Hypothesis: a fresh QSC-D head over the frozen L84/L87-A Z1 candidate states,
  with candidate self-attention followed by cross-attention to pure frozen
  GroundingDINO/BERT language tokens, could improve same-frame correspondence
  without changing the bank, detector, tracker, or ordinary MOT/OVMOT.
- Implementation: isolated worktree at
  `/data1/LWR/vranlee/SERVER_ONLY/avis/LocateMOT_L89`, base
  `ece9fc5549a9210424eb127fb10430c3fed7b7ba`; two set layers, eight heads,
  FFN 1024, hidden 256, history 8, 4,169,829 trainable parameters. Pure
  language cache has 3,418 label-free entries. Contract smoke passed after
  preserving two package/field failures. No token/span or static/motion
  supervision is verified (`UNALIGNED`).
- Fit: seed `20260829`, one GPU, BF16, 40 epochs/2,640 optimizer steps,
  finite loss and nonzero gradients, all 20 even checkpoints plus final.
  Only L49 fit supervision was used; no screening or official-test labels.
- Dev/selection: 20 checkpoints scored over 138 legal dev groups; five-item
  shortlist and full-video B/R/P matrix selected epoch 4, Rule R before fixed
  validation. Checkpoint SHA is
  `5ab3cb344b73b320b34de7b4bb41622ce665ecb17c4d90c1999640a318e69aa8`.
- Fixed semantic: authoritative retry4 failed. L29 was
  `recall=.7333333, precision=.0830189, FP/frame=10.125,
  pred/positive=8.8333, hard=.9166667, multi=.8194444`; L89 was
  `recall=.8709677, precision=.0794118, FP/frame=13.0417,
  pred/positive=10.9677, hard=.6923077, multi=.9027778`, with inactive
  false acceptance `1.0`. Hard-negative ranking moved, but deployable volume,
  precision, and no-match behavior failed.
- Internal TrackEval: frozen epoch4/Rule R on V1 validation (86 sequences)
  gave HOTA `2.2906`, V2 validation (537 sequences) HOTA `0.5894`, versus
  L87-A `28.5752/22.1300`. Full-video post-hoc target-row recall was only
  `.0131/.0026` and inactive acceptance was `1.0`. This is internal
  validation TrackEval evidence, not screening or official-test evidence.
- Root cause judgment: query-conditioned set representation gave limited
  frame-level ranking signal but failed calibrated persistent emission and
  absence handling. The branch is stopped pending supervisor review; no L89
  continuation, screening, official test, or ordinary MOT/OVMOT change is
  authorized. All L89 outputs are preserved under `outputs/l89/` and the new
  source/reports are on branch `codex/l89-query-conditioned-set-correspondence-20260907`.

## 2026-09-08 Stage L89C — corrected candidate-vs-NULL replay

- Hypothesis/repair: L89 training and the registered loss use `candidate_energy`
  against `null_logit`, but the old L89 evaluation/deployment path emitted
  using `presence_logit - null_logit`. L89C changed only the evaluation,
  selection, inference, and TrackEval contract to the shared
  `corrected_emission_mask`: candidate threshold, candidate-minus-NULL margin,
  and presence threshold. No training, scorer forward, bank/cache rebuild, or
  model/ordinary-MOT change was made.
- Inputs/selection: immutable L89 raw dev records (9,960; SHA recorded in
  `outputs/l89c/dev/corrected_shortlist_attempt1/`), 20 existing checkpoints,
  and the fixed manifest SHA
  `06da458b09aa3e61ce30a4f8b58a85ac31ef1a5a10d269abd64ae41cffd127fa`.
  Corrected dev TrackEval evaluated 5 checkpoints × B/R/P (15 results), then
  froze epoch 2 / Rule R, checkpoint SHA
  `f8b175597ece8aad1f0ec3ae9d05c70e0759a0f7480dff9af6ea2619a2e3f08b`, with
  candidate/presence/NULL thresholds `-0.75/-1.0/0.0` before fixed validation.
- Fixed semantic evidence: authoritative retry2 has 40 ordered records (16
  calibration, 24 validation), with preselection forbidden-label fields
  absent. Validation is recall `.8387097`, precision `.0869565`, FP/frame
  `11.375`, predictions/positive `9.6452`, hard violation `.6923077`,
  multi-positive recall `.8333333`, inactive false acceptance `1.0`.
  The gate is `semantic_gate_fail`: hard/recall/precision/multi floors pass,
  but volume and inactive/no-match conditions fail.
- Internal evidence: frozen epoch-2/Rule-R full-video inference covered V1
  `0004,0018` (86 sequences) and V2 `0016,0017,0020` (537 sequences).
  Corrected TrackEval HOTA is V1 `2.244718%`, V2 `0.583059%`; no screening or
  official-test labels were read. These are internal validation-scope metrics,
  not a final RMOT result. Historical buggy L89 was `2.2906%/0.5894%` and
  L87-A was `28.5752%/22.1300%` on V1/V2.
- First actionable root cause: corrected candidate-vs-NULL accounting still
  leaves no-match acceptance universal and output volume too high. All rows,
  keys, finite checks, and frozen boundaries passed; the initial GPU OOM is
  preserved as an implementation/resource attempt and the exact CPU retry
  completed. Unique next action: supervisor review and authorization of one
  new RMOT branch explicitly addressing absence/volume calibration with
  candidate correspondence. Do not extend L89/L89C or tune thresholds.
- Status: `STOPPED_PENDING_SUPERVISOR_REVIEW`; `zero_training=true`,
  `screening_gt_used=false`, `official_test_labels_read=false`,
  `ordinary_mot_ovmot_touched=false`.

## 2026-09-08 Stage L89D — true full-video timeline repair

- Hypothesis/scope: repair only the L89C sparse-prediction versus dense-GT
  timeline mismatch. No training, model, loss, bank, tracker, threshold, or
  ordinary MOT/OVMOT change was made. New code is confined to `tools/l89d_*`
  and new evidence is under `reports/l89d/` and `outputs/l89d/`.
- Contract repair: native L69 `frame_ids` and frame pointers now drive every
  video timeline; all query/frame pairs and all candidate rows are scored.
  The multi-video query-map overwrite was fixed and covered by a targeted
  regression. Dev inference attempt3 covers 1,152,690/1,152,690 candidate
  pairs across 2,385 frame groups; internal attempt1 covers
  243,550/243,550 pairs across 1,844 frame groups. Both passed full-video and
  pair-completeness checks. The dev and internal dense Z1 supplements were
  built from frozen query-independent caches and finalized with no labels.
- Dev evidence: the valid 5-checkpoint × B/R/P TrackEval matrix selected
  epoch 8 / Rule P on the preregistered dev tuple. The frozen checkpoint is
  `/data1/LWR/vranlee/SERVER_ONLY/avis/LocateMOT_L89/outputs/l89/train/joint40/checkpoint_l89_epoch008.pt`,
  SHA256 `28d4c35a189474d446a26fc096bbafbad77e1298429674383ce7ce8b14677d99`.
  The fixed 16-calibration/24-validation semantic replay then failed: recall
  `.5483871`, precision `.1517857`, FP/frame `3.9583333`,
  predictions/positive `3.6129032`, hard violation `.6923077`,
  multi-positive recall `.4861111`, inactive false acceptance `.6666667`.
  Recall and multi-positive floors failed; no screening/test labels were read.
- Internal evidence: fixed epoch 8 / Rule P true full-video TrackEval gives
  combined HOTA `23.8586078862%`, DetA `15.1294290119%`, AssA
  `37.9461647913%`, DetRe `57.2559333985%`, DetPr `16.9954368707%`, IDF1
  `18.6931722536%`, and IDSW `6337.5`; V1 HOTA `25.0798607896%`, V2 HOTA
  `22.6373549828%`. These are internal validation-scope TrackEval results,
  not screening, official-test, or final ordinary-RMOT evidence.
- Attempts preserved: dev ENOSPC, internal exit-137/OOM retries, the expected
  smoke full-video rejection, the selector directory-argument error, and the
  earlier multi-video GT-map mismatch. The final boundary guard passed after
  the path contract correction. The fixed manifest SHA remained
  `06da458b09aa3e61ce30a4f8b58a85ac31ef1a5a10d269abd64ae41cffd127fa`.
- Status: `L89D_COMPLETE_ZERO_TRAINING_TRUE_FULLVIDEO_REPAIR /
  semantic_gate_fail / STOPPED_PENDING_SUPERVISOR_REVIEW`.
  Flags: `zero_training=true`, `screening_gt_used=false`,
  `official_test_labels_read=false`, `ordinary_mot_ovmot_touched=false`.
  Unique next action: supervisor review and authorization of one separate
  absence/volume-calibration study; do not extend L89/L89C or alter the
  production MOT/OVMOT paths.

## 2026-09-09 Stage L89E — phase-consistent temporal/history replay

- Hypothesis/scope: L89D evaluated every checkpoint with temporal history
  enabled even though L89 training used Stage-S epochs 1–8 with temporal off
  and zero history. L89E changed only this replay contract: S epochs 2/4/6/8
  use `temporal_enabled=false` and zero history; T epochs 10–20 and J epochs
  22–40 use causal last-four history. No training, model, loss, bank, tracker,
  threshold science, UIDM, ordinary MOT or OVMOT source was changed.
- Implementation: isolated branch/worktree based on L89D commit
  `d0960e1d1679414765f79203bef444f0f9968928`; phase policy and wrappers are
  in `tools/l89e_*`. The required CPU equality check passed for S and T
  `L86ClipStore` history construction. The first replay failure was a
  `FrameExample`/`_clip_history` interface mismatch; the minimal adapter fix
  passed a targeted S/T causality regression. A subsequent historical-score
  merge check found that the immutable sparse file contains S+T/J rows; the
  wrapper now filters only the historical T/J epochs and preserves their
  values. Launch-path and shortlist argument mistakes were preserved as
  `INCOMPLETE`/operator evidence; no affected model run was treated as data.
- Stage-S evidence: fresh phase-correct replay of epochs 2/4/6/8 completed
  `4 x 498 = 1,992` records, all finite, complete and zero-history. Merged
  phase-consistent fit/dev pool contains 20 epochs and 9,960 records. The
  registered maximum-five fit/dev shortlist was frozen at epochs
  `8(S),20(T),40(J),32(J),4(S)`.
- Dev selection: full native dev replay retained `11,003,527/11,003,527`
  candidate rows for all five shortlist candidates. The 15-result TrackEval
  matrix selected epoch 4 / phase S / Rule B by the registered tuple; dev
  HOTA was `0.296512` (internal fit/dev selection evidence only).
- Fixed semantic evidence: the new 16-calibration/24-validation replay used
  the frozen epoch-4/S zero-history policy and Rule B. Immutable L29 remains
  recall/precision/FP-frame/pred-positive/hard/multi
  `.7333333/.0830189/10.125/8.8333/.9166667/.8194444`. L89E validation is
  recall/precision/FP-frame/pred-positive/hard/multi
  `.4516129/.1458333/3.4166667/3.0967742/.7692308/.3611111`, with inactive
  false acceptance `.8333333` and empty rate `.2083333`. The semantic gate
  fails recall and multi-positive floors despite lower volume and higher
  precision; no threshold rescue was performed.
- Internal TrackEval: after the frozen selection, exact internal timeline
  replay covered `243,550/243,550` pairs for V1 0004/0018 and V2 0016/0017/0020.
  Phase-consistent HOTA/DetA/AssA/DetRe/DetPr were V1
  `28.7628/18.7680/44.3927/80.3045/19.5312%` and V2
  `21.8385/13.3358/35.9990/45.1160/15.8179%`; IDSW was 1,997 and 9,915.
  These are internal validation-scope TrackEval results, not screening or
  official-test results.
- Root cause: correcting S-phase temporal/history evaluation does not
  restore expression correspondence; the fixed emission remains recall- and
  multi-positive-limited, with substantial inactive acceptance. Status is
  `L89E_COMPLETE_ZERO_TRAINING_PHASE_CONSISTENT_REPLAY /
  semantic_gate_fail / STOPPED_PENDING_SUPERVISOR_REVIEW`.
- Preserved outputs: Stage-S attempts 1–4, merge attempts 1–2, shortlist
  attempts 1–4, dev/internal full-video and TrackEval outputs, fixed semantic
  output, and all reports under `reports/l89e/` and `outputs/l89e/`. The fixed
  manifest SHA remains
  `06da458b09aa3e61ce30a4f8b58a85ac31ef1a5a10d269abd64ae41cffd127fa`.
  Flags remain `zero_training=true`, `screening_gt_used=false`,
  `official_test_labels_read=false`, `ordinary_mot_ovmot_touched=false`.
- The only next action is supervisor review of a separately authorized
  absence/volume-calibration study. Do not extend L89/L89C/L89E, alter the
  bank, or touch production MOT/OVMOT.

## R0A — safe target contract, dense native indexes, and implementation smoke — 2026-09-09

- Hypothesis: isolate only allowlisted V1/V2 target records, repair the
  frame-specific target contract, and construct native-frame R0 data without
  parsing forbidden official-eval payloads.
- Safe-source retry3 passed: lexical monolithic-JSON isolation deserialized
  only allowlisted video values and recorded
  `forbidden_payload_deserialized=false` and
  `official_test_labels_read=false`.  The exact 5,314 sparse fit rows matched
  the authoritative frame map with zero sentence/target/missing-query/invalid-
  frame mismatches.
- Dense native-frame index retry2 and its contract audit passed for V1/V2;
  all L69 rows and duplicate candidate indices were retained.  The geometry
  `image_hw` and visual-cache dataset/group-key contracts were corrected in
  R0-only files.  Retry1 dense/smoke failures remain preserved with their
  first trace; retry2 is authoritative.
- Real R0 contract smoke retry2 passed on one V1 fit frame: loss
  `3.555824041366577`, 108/108 finite nonzero trainable gradients, frozen
  GroundingDINO, no tracker optimizer parameters, strict reload max diff `0`,
  and temporary visual item removed.  This is implementation evidence only;
  no semantic, screening, official-test, HOTA, or production MOT/OVMOT result.
- Next action: commit/freeze the R0A safe code and construct the registered
  query-independent visual cache on `/data2`; no old asset or production
  entrypoint is modified.
