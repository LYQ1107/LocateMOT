## 2026-08-19 Stage L11 — OVMOT temporal pseudo-track + KITTI front-end

- Hypothesis: unmatched DLA detections on expanded TAO-train OVMOT
  stream must receive high-precision temporal pseudo-track supervision
  instead of "every detection is NEW"; KITTI RMOT DetPr ~1% is a
  candidate front-end problem, fixable with category whitelist + NMS +
  query-conditioned CLIP top-k.
- Implementation:
  - Pseudo-track generator (forward + backward cycle consistency,
    appearance/motion/category filters, confidence gating) for all 500
    TAO train videos; sidecars in `outputs/l11/data/pseudo_tracks`.
  - Class-A GT upgraded from C-TAO base @0.5 IoU to base_and_novel
    @0.3 IoU (~10% -> ~28% coverage).
  - Trainer: no_unmatched_new, confidence-weighted identity/relevance
    losses, pseudo ids in the same slot/lifecycle machinery.
  - KITTI: whitelist + cross-NMS + top-30 -> ~15.3 cands/frame (was 50);
    CLIP top-12 calibration: query precision 10.2%, target recall 65%.
- Quality: pseudo same-ID precision 99.26% (8-video audit, target 90%);
  cycle pass 0.997; NEW rate 0.110 vs L10 collapse ~1.0.
- Running: 4-GPU repair training (from L9-ovmot, ~6-8 s/step),
  repaired-KITTI eval (L9-ovmot ckpt), 10-video OVMOT over-birth
  baseline: unique/rows 0.211 (L9), reused IDs 467.
- Pending: step-7000 OVMOT quick eval, full TAO TETA, KITTI TrackEval,
  L12 prompt seeding.

## 2026-08-20 continued

- Low-LR continuation (10000->11000, LR~6e-6): RMOT-Dance 32.49 ->
  34.05 HOTA; ordinary Macro 0.4855 -> 0.4924.  OVMOT full TETA on
  s11k running.
- Fresh-optimizer balance run (p_rmot 0.45/p_ovmot 0.20) REJECTED at
  step 1000 (RMOT 32.06 / ordinary 0.4663).
- L12 frozen prompt-seeded (DAVIS 2017, 10 multi-object videos):
  mask/point > box for identity robustness; joint fine-tune not
  launched (mixed signal).  Infrastructure complete.

## 2026-09-04 Stage L88 — RMOT-aware GroundingDINO LoRA adaptation

- Hypothesis: a zero-initialized rank-16/alpha-32 LoRA on the final two
  GroundingDINO fusion layers and decoder layer 0, with the frozen L86/L87
  sidecar and causal history, would improve held-out target-bag and
  expression-to-candidate correspondence without changing the L69 bank.
- Contract: label-free, distributed, and temporal regressions passed; full
  V1/V2 fit used seed `20260829`, 40 epochs, 2,640 optimizer steps, world 4,
  effective group batch 8, and 20 even checkpoints. Local MMCV required FP32
  rather than the registered BF16 autocast. Candidate deletion/truncation was
  false and all frozen-base/LoRA gradient and reload checks passed.
- Dev: all 20 checkpoints were scored on 138 video-disjoint groups; the fixed
  selection chose epoch20/Rule B before fixed validation. Checkpoint SHA is
  `7012706140cfa94278ce15bb8da3e2318eb3efcfb8d26d3b1dbc5206f1145538`.
- Fixed semantic validation: immutable L29 was
  `recall=.7333333, precision=.0830189, FP/frame=10.125,
  pred/positive=8.8333, hard=.9166667, multi=.8194444`. L88 candidate-only
  was `recall=.4193548, precision=.1830986, FP/frame=2.4167,
  pred/positive=2.2903, hard=.8461538, multi=.3333333`; final Rule B was
  `recall=.1935484, precision=.1363636, FP/frame=1.5833,
  pred/positive=1.4194, hard=.8461538, multi=.1666667`, with empty rate
  `.5416667` and inactive false acceptance `.5`. The semantic gate failed on
  recall and multi-positive preservation; the lower volume is not a fix.
- Internal TrackEval: selected Rule B produced HOTA `26.0914` (V1) and
  `20.2386` (V2), below L86 `29.1663/21.6467` and L87-A
  `28.5752/22.1300`. No screening or official-test labels were read.
- Preserved failures/fixes: first formal causal-key drift, sparse seqinfo,
  merge, device, and score-shape retries remain in new directories with their
  provenance; no old bank/checkpoint/production entrypoint was overwritten.
- Status: `STOPPED_PENDING_SUPERVISOR_REVIEW`; no L88 long continuation,
  screening, official test, TrackEval beyond internal validation, or
  ordinary MOT/OVMOT change is authorized. Unique next action is supervisor
  review of one new RMOT correspondence/proposal design.
